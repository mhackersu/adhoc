# Innovation

## Purpose

The purpose of this exercise is to get a greater understanding of how you approach new client work and design problems.

## Instructions

Imagine you've been approached to design an interface that allows a patient to schedule an appointment with their doctor online.

### Submission

In preparation for your first call with this potential new client:

- Outline 5 reasons this doctor's office should pursue a discovery sprint, before committing to a solution.

Prepare a set of questions to bring to a kick-off meeting. You know that their current systems have some rudimentary online tools, but it's mostly a paper-driven organization.

- As a designer, what are the first 10 questions that you would ask?

Answer in under 500 words, and store as a plain text file (without any personally identifying information).
